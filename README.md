April 2025 - Week 2 Day 1 - TKH Innovation Fellowship: Intro To Arrays  

---
 ## Objectives ðŸŽ¯

 * We are focusing on learning what Arrays are in JavaScript and how they work in relation to what we've been working with so far
    * Today we covered how to calculate the length of things within an array and manipulate the values of the things stored within the array
    * We also learned about using methods like .push() or .pop() to add/remove things within an array
    * We ended with learning about for loops and visually representing how they look within the console to visually see how for loops work in terms of what they return
